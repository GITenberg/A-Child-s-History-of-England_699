description: "A Child's History of England is a book by Charles Dickens. It first\
  \ appeared in serial form in Household Words, running from January 25, 1851 to December\
  \ 10, 1853. Dickens also published the work in book form in three volumes: the first\
  \ volume on December 20, 1851; the second, December 25, 1852; and the third, December\
  \ 24, 1853. Although the volumes were published in December, each was postdated\
  \ the following year. They bore the titles:\nVolume I. – England from the Ancient\
  \ Times, to the Death of King John (1852)\nVolume II. – England from the Reign of\
  \ Henry the Third, to the Reign of Richard the Third (1853)\nVolume III. – England\
  \ from the Reign of Henry the Seventh to the Revolution of 1688 (1854)\nDickens\
  \ dedicated the book to \"My own dear children, whom I hope it may help, bye and\
  \ bye, to read with interest larger and better books on the same subject\". The\
  \ history covered the period between 50 BC and 1689, ending with a chapter summarising\
  \ events from then until the accession of Queen Victoria. \nA Child's History was\
  \ included in the curricula of British School children well into the 20th century,\
  \ with successive editions published from 1851 to World War II.\n From Wikipedia\
